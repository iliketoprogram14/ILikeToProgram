          <h2>The Story</h2>
          <div class="story1">
            <span class="number">1</span>
              When we started our project, we got excited by the prospect of visualizing trends in bitcoins. 
              Specifically, we wanted to investigate whether or not buying bitcoin was a sound financial 
              investment. Not up to speed on bitcoin? Check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/63502573">this video</a>
              and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo">this video</a>.
          </div>
          <div class="story2">
            <span class="number">2</span>
            Our visualization is composed of two main parts. The first part is a small multiples area
            visualization which plots the change in value of stock investments. The user can select which
            company stock or stock index to dynamically add or remove through the control functionality 
            at the top right corner of the visualization. Additionally, the visualization plots the price
            of a bitcoin (mtgoxUSD) since its origin (July 2010).  There is also the option of changing
            the visualization data from any of open, close, low, or high price, in addition to financial
            transaction volume. Volume is plotted in thousands of dollars because that is the form in
            which the data is provided from the Bitcoin API. This is in part due to the extremely
            volatile pricing and mutlitide of currencies in which it is transacted.  Additionally this 
            helps compare the transaction volume to stocks, whose units in numbers are not as meaningful
            as in transaction volume. Finally the y-scale of the charts is unique for each of the plots
            because they have wide variations in pricing. Nonetheless, the important factor in investment
            comparison is percent change over time, which is dynamically generated when the plot is clicked.
          </div>
          <div class="story3">
            <span class="number">3</span>
            The second part of the visualization are the bar charts linked down below. These charts are 
            meant to allow comparisons between different stocks and bitcoins on a given day.
          </div>
          <div class="story4">
            <span class="number">4</span>
            From the visualization we can see that although typically bitcoin is not considered an
            investment vehicle, and although it boasts much lower aggregate financial transaction volume,
            the recent jump in price has led it to have extremely high return on investment. There has
            also been a vast instability in bitcoin price in the past few weeks.  In order to determine
            the impact of hype and media on bitcoin pricing, we have also added the number of "bitcoin"
            Google searches and relevant news stories about bitcoins alongside the pricing. The search
            units are scaled from 0 - 100 in terms of the ratio of searches in a given week to the week
            with the maximum number of searches, as this is the way the data is provided by Google
            Trends. Try clicking "Bitcoin Search Trends."  From these data points, it becomes evident that
            bitcoin is <strong>highly</strong> correlated with news and hype, which may be largely
            responsible for the recent instability in bitcoin pricing. Additionally there are red tick
            marks below the bitcoin plot, which on hover, display relevant news stories about bitcoin on
            those days to add more of a qualitative side to the bitcoin picture. Moral of the story? Buy a
            bunch of bitcoin and then spread positive viral news stories about it! More seriously though,
            it seems that bitcoin may be a high risk, high return alternative to common investments.

            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CEP6IoLDQA">screencast</a>!  You can also see our
            process book <a href="/404.html"> here</a>. The screencast highlights many of the interactive
            elements of our visualization including the different data views, adding and removing stocks
            dynamically, the area chart tooltip, the dynamic delta lines, panning/zooming the area chart,
            the linked bar charts, the trends data and news articles, and more. The process book goes
            through the thought process we went through in building our visualization.

          <div class="story6">
            <span class="number">6</span>
            When we first started out this project, Bitcoin was valued at around $35. Since then, the
            price has skyrockted. Immediately after submitting Project 2, the price of Bitcoin enjoyed a
            huge increase, up to $240! Right after that, the price crashed to as low as $60, and then
            recovered to around $120 and has been increasing ever since. We can clearly see how volatile
            the price of Bitcoin has been relative to almost every other stock on the market, thanks to
            the dynamic stocks feature.  <p/>The purpose of project 3 was to determine what the
            correlation between the price of bitcoin and the media was, and the last month of price
            changes gave us an ample opportunity to explore this. We can clearly see that more people
            searched for Bitcoin during the last month, and that the quality of articles (and the
            sensationalism) of the articles has also increased with the huge price changes. Although the
            price has been changing a lot, the volume of Bitcoin that's been traded over the past month
            has increased astronomically, and visually correlates well to the trends plot and to the
            quality of articles about Bitcoin.

            <p/>Because this isn't rigorous analysis, we can't be quite sure if Bitcoin's increased
            popularity is the cause of its volatility in price and the trading volume increases. We're
            also not sure if the dramatic changes in price are the causes of Bitcoin's popularity. They're
            almost definitely related however, and we hope this visualization will give rise to more
            exploration into this issue. Thank you for visiting our project!
