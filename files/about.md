# About me and this site

<img src="/assets/images/prof_pic150.jpg" id="profile-picture" width="150" align="right">

Hi! My name is Randy Miller. This site originally started as a place to host work done in and outside of college before GitHub became popular.  It's now a place to help others who run into similar problems or just want to browse those simple college projects, viewable at my [GitHub](http://github.com/iliketoprogram14).

This site was originally built with PHP and a SQL database so that I wouldn't lose touch with my web programming skills, but I've since transitioned to using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to take advantage of hosting on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
