Hi! This site details my life as a programmer so far. It contains a lot of my work in and outside of school, most of which can be downloaded. This site was originally built with PHP so that I wouldn't lose touch with my web programming skills, but I've since transitioned to using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Hopefully this site will help others if they're working on similar projects or those who just want to read more code.
