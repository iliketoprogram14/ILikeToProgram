# About me and this site

Hi! My name is Randy Miller. This site originally started as a place to host work done in and outside of college before GitHub became popular.  It's now a place to help others who run into similar problems or just want to browse those simple college projects, viewable on my [GitHub](http://github.com/iliketoprogram14){:target="_blank"}.

This site was originally built with PHP and a SQL database so that I wouldn't lose touch with my web programming skills, but I've since transitioned to using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} to take advantage of hosting initially on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/){:target="_blank"} and now on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
