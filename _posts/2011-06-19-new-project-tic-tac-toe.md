That was awesome. 

I decided to crank out Tic Tac Toe in Java instead of working on the Android app, and I got it done in around 5 hours. 

To be honest though, I did use the game engine from <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs51/hw/ps8.pdf" target="blank">CS 51's checkers pset</a>. Hopefully, though, I'll be changing the game engine quite a bit, and I'll definitely be making this an applet or a desktop application instead of printing out the board. 

In the meantime, check out the first release of Tic Tac Toe on <a href="projects.php?project=4">the downloads page</a>.
