That was awesome. 

I decided to crank out Tic Tac Toe in Java instead of working on the Android app, and I got it done in around 5 hours.

To be honest though, I did use the game engine from [CS 51's checkers pset](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/7591){:target="blank"}. Hopefully, though, I'll be changing the game engine quite a bit, and I'll definitely be making this an applet or a desktop application instead of printing out the board. 

In the meantime, check out Tic Tac Toe on the [GitHub page]({{ site.data.projects['tictactoe'].url }})).
