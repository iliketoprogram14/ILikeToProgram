I finally got around to finishing the ["Bit Twiddling Hacks"]({{ site.data.projects['bithacks'].url }}). I've included a Makfile with the source code for those who want to play with these hacks. This project was completed in bits (haha, see what I did there?) over the course of the last semester, but I didn't consolidate the hacks until the beginning of the summer. I didn't really start going quickly until the summer, by which time I had a pretty decent template for each hack. Anywho, this was a great project because I got to work more with Makefiles and what not.

At work, I made my first extensive shell scripts, and that was actually pretty exciting. I'd love to post it, except it's for work, and that'd be bad. But I have a feeling I'm going to be using scripts for everything, and will probably be spending more time on Greasemonkey...
