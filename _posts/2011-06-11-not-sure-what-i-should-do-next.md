Since I've finished <a href="{{ site.data.projects['99problems'].url }}">Ocaml's 99 Problems</a> and the <a href="{{ site.data.projects['bithacks'].url }}">Bit Twiddling Hacks</a> in C, it's time to start a new project. I think I'm going to start developing in Android today, as it's a huge platform that's only growing, and I can carry any program I make in my pocket, which is always cool. Building a widget for the Harvard Shuttle seems pretty interesting, and it can be useful to my immediate community in college. If you have ideas or suggestions about what you would like to see in an app like this, I'm more than open to suggestions.
