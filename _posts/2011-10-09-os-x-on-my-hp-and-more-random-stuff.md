Yep, school has started. I'm only taking 3 classes (out of the usual 4), but I'm doing a ton to keep myself busy, including research and holding office hours for Harvard's Systems class.

<!--more-->

I reinstalled Mac OS X to my laptop (which is a PC). It now dual boots OS X Lion, and I plan on reinstalling Ubuntu to another hard drive so I can mess with the kernel some more. I keep telling myself that I'll get around to making the ISBN scanner app, but things always keep coming up.

I also rebound (re-binded?) my Meta key in Emacs to Alt. Turns out Growl, a notification service I use, decided to make Alt a global-notification-dismiss key, so I'm beyond happy that's working.

I had planned on making my own Emacs mode for making outlines, but then I found out that outline mode already existed. So, I changed its regex to now search for traditional outline style instead of stars, and it's a beauty. I may work on extending the mode so that it will automatically make a new heading when I hit return, and maybe I'll add some shortcuts to switch between heading levels quickly.

I do need some goals for the semester. Here may be a good (and ambitious) list:
 - Make the iPhone application part of the ISBN scanner
 - Finish Python's 99 Problems
 - Make some application in F#
 - Translate my music player to C++ and make better documentation for it
 - Extend Emacs Outline Mode
 - Make a Python stock valuation application
 
We'll see how much of this I actually get done!!!
