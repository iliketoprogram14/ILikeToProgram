I added <a href="doc/Playlist Shuffler/Index.html" target="_blank">documentation for the playlist shuffler</a>.You can also download <a href="projects.php?project=6">the help file from the downloads page</a>.

Depending on feedback, I'll decide later if I should redo the iTunes music library locating wizard or just make it automatic.
