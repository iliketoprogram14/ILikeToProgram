title: Playing in the sand - documentation with Sandcastle

I used [Sandcastle]("http://sandcastle.codeplex.com"){"target="blank"} to generate documentation for my C# playlist shuffler.

I added <a href="doc/Playlist Shuffler/Index.html" target="_blank">documentation for the playlist shuffler</a>. You can also download <a href="{{ site.data.projects['playlistshuffler'].url }}">the help file from the downloads page</a>.

Depending on feedback, I'll decide later if I should redo the iTunes music library locating wizard or just make it automatic.
