description: I've added documentation using Sandcaslte for my music player written in C# for Windows.

I used [Sandcastle](http://sandcastle.codeplex.com){"target="blank"} to generate documentation for my C# playlist shuffler.

I added [documentation for the playlist shuffler](https://iliketoprogram14.github.io/MusicPlayerWindow/Index.html){:target="_blank"}. (4/10/17 - the documentation has been taken down for now)

Depending on feedback, I'll decide later if I should redo the iTunes music library locating wizard or just make it automatic.
