<a href="projects.php?project=6">The playlist shuffler beta release</a> is up.I added graphics, a working info pane with scrolling capabilities, and a thumbnail toolbar that allows the user to control the player (sadly, I can't change playlists via jumplists, which would've been awesome).For the final release, I plan to add all documentation and a spec, and maybe a mess around with searching for the iTunes Music Library.

Currently, the application prompts the user to browse for the iTunes/Music directory, but it may be easier to just search for the iTunes xml library and hope for the best.At the end of the day, I need to design a way to handle errors from a bad library or xml file (the xml file may not be up to date), so that may take up tomorrow night.

Other than those minor issues, I'm done!
