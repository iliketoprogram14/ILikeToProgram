I've almost finished with the new design. Right now the Projects page is almost done; the only thing missing right now is making programming language links active such that they lead to a list of projects.

<!--more-->

Originally, I wanted to treat languages for projects like tags for posts: clicking a language will display all the projects that were "tagged" with that language. However, currently only one project is displayed at a time, so I think I'm going to make another separate page for viewing projects by language that may look more like a search results screen.

I also need to think about limiting the number of posts per page on the Home page. That shouldn't be too hard; I'll probably just use GET in php to take care of that functionality.

After that, I just need to add photos of completed projects and then whip up the Plans page, which should be extremely easy given that most of the work for it has already been done for the Projects page. Then, I'll need to move the new contents of the site, so I'll need to adjust a few links for that.

Lastly, I'll need some type of icon or logo to stick in the middle of the navigation bar at the top of each page. I'm not sure what to put there just yet, but hopefully it will be somewhat creative :P
