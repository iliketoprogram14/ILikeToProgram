The final version of tic tac toe is now ready for its first release.

You can download the source code for the application on the [GitHub page]({{ site.data.projects['tictactoe'].url }}){:target="_blank"}.  I've also uploaded the [formal documentation](https://iliketoprogram14.github.io/TicTacToeApplication/){:target="_blank"} to view as well. 

I'd post more, but I'm a combination of happiness and exhaustion right now, so I'm going to grab some sleep :)
