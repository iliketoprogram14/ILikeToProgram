You are now (as of the time that this post was written) looking at the new site! I've finally gotten to a point where the new site is fully functional and looks semi-decent, so I decided to make the switch. 

<!--more-->

To get an idea about how big this makeover is, here's a screenshot of the old site: 

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/images/oldsite.png" height="400px" width="420px" alt="Old site"/> 

Yeah, that's not too sightly. And it was hard to navigate. 

 Hopefully this site improves on everything the old site was bad at and more. The blog portion of the site is now paginated, and like I mentioned before, the plans and the projects pages are much more well-formatted. Also tags and programming languages are clickable, so you can sort data information relatively quickly. 

 The last things to add include photos for the projects, a main logo to put in the navigation bar, comments to the main project (should've done that earlier lol), and a fully-functional uploading system to ease the pain of adding new content and modifying this site. Hopefully by the time I've finished the uploading system, it should almost be on par with a real content manager like WordPress for example. I'll post screenshots later on to demonstrate how it works once it's finished.
