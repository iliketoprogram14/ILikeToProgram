Yay!!!I didn't really work on the applet until this week, and even then, I could not figure out how to handle new games and/or resets. Now, it completely works fine and everything :)There's only a few things I need to work out.

<!--more-->

First I need to correctly handle the menu items. They work for the most part, but some settings are currently hard coded into the program. I also need to handle how the game ends, which I can do by presenting a dialog to the user once the game is over. After that, I want to work on adding delays in between rounds; currently any delays makes the GUI ugly. Lastly, I can add new types of players pretty easily to the program so that the user has more choices of opponents.

Until then (which is probably early next week), check out the new <a href="projects.php?project=4">source code</a> on the download page!
