This site needs some shaking up. It's hard to read, has a pretty poor palette, and is pretty hard to navigate. It's also pretty simple, and doesn't provide me any design challenges.

So how am I going to remedy this?

I really like the blog-like style I have going on, but it's not very integrated/relevant to any projects or plans on the other pages. I'm going to make posts much more uniform and well-formatted. I will also support labels like a traditional blog, so I can group posts together and essentially tag projects.

Completed projects and plans will also be much more well-formatted and clean. Right now, the plans and downloads page are just walls of text. A nice concise format will solve this problem, and I also plan to add pictures to make the experience a bit more user-friendly.

Basically, I'm making my own content manager so that I have complete control over everything. I'll get to experience solving website design problems and messing with css styles and database design.
